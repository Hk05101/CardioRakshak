This project focuses on early detection of heart disease using supervised machine learning models on the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Several pretrained models—Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN—were implemented and evaluated. Data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and normalization were applied to improve model accuracy. The models were assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Among all, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in supporting early diagnosis and enhancing clinical decision-making.
